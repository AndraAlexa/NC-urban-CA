This is the repository containing the source code, images and graphs and results for Natural Computing course projects. For this project Natalie Widmann and Andra Alexa worked together. The main focus of our project was to model urban development by using an urban CA grid.

The repository is organized as follows:
1. Folder Code contains the python files we developped
2. Folder EMDimages contains the generations on the city of Milford
3. Folder Images cintains the initial MassGIS images used in our simulations (source http://maps.massgis.state.ma.us/map_ol/oliver.php)
4. Folder Results containing the results (images) of our simulations for the cities of Boston, Milford and Fitchburg as well as for the artificially generated city. 

Detailed information about the project, methods and results are detailed in the project report.
